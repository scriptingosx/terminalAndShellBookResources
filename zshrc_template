# you can either copy pieces of this file to your .zshrc
# or use this as a template (move this file to the root of your home directory
# and rename to .zshrc) and then modify to suit your needs

# Permission is granted to use this code in any way you want.
# Credit would be nice, but not obligatory.
# Provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.


# uncomment for immediate visual feedback that this file is read correctly
# echo "my .zshrc file"


# FUNCTIONS

function xman {
    open x-man-page://$1
}


# ALIASES

alias ll='ls -l'
alias lll="ls -alhTOe@"

# override the standard `man` to use the `xman` function
alias man=xman

# you _could_ just name the function `man` for the same effect, but you can see this
# override when listing aliases. It is helpful to have all configurations that override 
# existing commands in the same place. Also, aliases are easier to bypass than functions.
# i.e. `\man` will use the standard command, rather than the alias.


# EDITOR

# the EDITOR variable is used by some command lines tools, e.g. git, when editing 
# text is part of a workflow.
# Graphical text editors often have special flags that inform the application that
# it is being launched as part of a CLI workflow

# un-comment the line for your favored text editor

# export EDITOR="open -f"              # Text Edit
# export EDITOR="atom --wait"          # Atom
# export EDITOR="bbedit -w --resume"   # BBEdit
# export EDITOR=emacs                  # Emacs
# export EDITOR=nano                   # nano
# export EDITOR="subl -n -w"           # Sublime Text
# export EDITOR="see --wait --resume"  # SubEthaEdit
# export EDITOR="mate -w"              # TextMate
# export EDITOR=vim                    # vim
# export EDITOR="code --wait"          # Visual Studio Code
# export EDITOR="xed --wait"           # Xcode
